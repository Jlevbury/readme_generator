## Description
This projects intent was to utilize Node.JS modules and functions to utilize NPM packages and built in features to create a README generator.  It would consist of an index.js file to hold the  initialized script to operate out of, and the addition of a generateMarkdown.js to act as a module to provide functions to be imported into the index.js file.

## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)

## Installation
No installation required.

## Usage
after opening the "index.js" file, running the node command "node index.js" will initialize the script and begin the prompt of questions. After completing these questions, a markdown file will be written based off of the users inputs.
